    <h2>How does inflation unemployment?</h2>
    <p>
There is evidence that inflation can reduce the rate of unemployment. As unemployment reduces, employers are compelled to increase wages to hire more workers. But, as wages rise, so do prices and people's spending power, leading to more inflation. Therefore, it is commonly believed that inflation and unemployment are inversely correlated. However, this relationship does not always hold. For example, the 1990s were boom years, where both inflation and unemployment were low. This is because technological adoption increased productivity, global competition kept prices down and demographic changes with more aging "baby boomers" and fewer younger people working. in more recent years, between 2012 and 2015 it can be seen that both inflation and unemployment declined together.

    <h2>What is the relationship between wages and inflation?</h2>
    <p>
A wage increase is a good thing, and every people wants it. However, If the inflation rate increases faster than the wage increase rate, it becomes another story. In macroeconomics, there is a theory called Wage-Price Spiral. The theory suggests that, in the initial term, rising wages increase disposable income while consumer goods prices are not changing. Because people have more money to spend, the demand for goods increases. While it is impossible to have a simultaneous rise in supply in the short run, the increase in demand will lead to a price increase for goods. The rising prices then put pressure on wages and push wages to increase again. So, in the end, a Wage-Price spiral is formed. This is not a good thing since it encourages production. 

It is hard to say whether the wage is the cause or effect of inflation. Wages and Prices are independent but result in a spiral. For example, in the 1970s, People suffered from the Wage-Price spiral caused by the increase in Oil Prices, which led to inflation and a recession.  

Since 2020 Q1, the average wages have increased. However, the inflation rate is snowballing rapidly. We are in the Wage-Price Spiral. The Federal Reserve has used monetary policies to encourage people to save more when they have disposable money. The pressure on goods prices can be lower.

    <h2>How does inflation impact mortgage interest rates?</h2>
    <p>
Many people view inflation in terms of the rising cost of fuel, groceries, electricity, and other goods and services. Mortgage rates may appear even less related to inflationary pressures. However, a connection exists between the two. The correlation between the trends of inflation and mortgage rates is evident from their patterns. By comparing their respective historical graphs, we can see that mortgage rates and inflation tend to move in tandem.

Inflation is a self-reinforcing cycle; the longer it persists, the more pernicious its consequences become, and increasing mortgage rates are an unfortunate consequence. The fundamental concept is that mortgages behave similarly to bonds: when inflation and purchasing power increase, interest rates must rise to maintain investor interest.

The Federal Reserve is the central bank of the United States; however, it does not directly regulate mortgage interest rates. Instead, it regulates the interest rates that banks charge each other for overnight loans to fulfill reserve requirements. Therefore, when the Fed raises its rate, mortgage lenders tend to follow suit, as was the case in 2022 after the Fed increased its federal funds rate by 0.25 percentage points in March.
